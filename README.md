# Power-Bi-Dashboard
This project utilizes data analytics techniques to gain insights from a dataset. Data analytics is the process of examining large amounts of data to uncover hidden patterns, correlations, trends and insights. It involves collecting, organizing and analyzing business data with tools such as data mining, statistical analysis and data visualization. The goal is to describe, predict and prescribe actions based on historical data patterns to inform business decisions. In this project, we will clean, explore and visualize the data to detect interesting relationships between variables. Machine learning algorithms will then be employed to build predictive models. The findings and models can help optimize business operations and strategies. Data analytics provides a fact-based, data-driven approach to decision making and problem solving compared to subjective assessments.
